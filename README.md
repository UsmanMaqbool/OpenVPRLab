# OpenVPRLab

**OpenVPRLab** is a comprehensive open-source framework for visual place recognition (VPR). It is designed to accelerate the training and iterative development of deep models for VPR, making it easier for researchers and developers to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

**Your Visual Place Recognition journey starts here**

## Features

* **Easy Dataset Management** : No more cumbersome dataset downloads. With a single command, you can download the GSV-Cities dataset and start your experiments immediately.
* **Built-in Validation** : Comes with three pre-configured validation datasets, allowing you to start training and monitor validation scores effortlessly.
* **Highly Modular Design** : Our modular architecture lets you focus on specific aspects of VPR without worrying about other components, providing a seamless development experience.
* **Extensive Loss Functions** : Leverage dozens of loss functions from the deep metric learning community through the integrated `deep_metric_learning` library, enabling advanced model optimization and experimentation.
* Track your experiments with integrated Tensorboard support
* Visualize your model performance (showing hard retrievals, missed retrievals)
* Develop your own aggregator, your own backbone, or loss function
